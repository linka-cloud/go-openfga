# go-openfga

go-openfga is a simple implementation of an easy to use (and currently partial) client for the [OpenFGA](https://github.com/openfga/openfga) gRPC API.

It also provides a simple way to run openfga in process.

**Project status: *alpha***

Not all planned features are completed.
The API, spec, status and other user facing objects are subject to change.
We do not support backward-compatibility for the alpha releases.
